== Day 00: Hello World in C++

=== The code

This is a simple C++ template.

It reads the input in a list of lines using a `FileHandler` class implementing _RAII_.
[source,cpp,numbered]
----
include::solution.cpp[tags=fileHandler]
----

And it does something incredibly meaningful with the input:
[source,cpp,numbered]
----
include::solution.cpp[tags=solve]
----

=== Run it with CMake

I use CMake and its integration in VS Code to build (`F7`) and run (`Shift+F5`) the solution with this simple `CMakeLists.txt`
[source,cmake,numbered]
----
include::CMakeLists.txt[]
