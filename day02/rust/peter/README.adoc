== Rust | Day 2: Cube Conundrum

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2[AoC|2023|2].

=== Input

As it is the case quite often, parsing the input was the biggest part of today's puzzle. Maybe I should stop separate parsing the input and solving the challenge and just do it in one pass?

=== Star 1

iter (enumerated) ... filter ... map ... sum

=== Star 2

iter ... map (nested iter ... fold) ... map ... sum

=== Tests

I proudly announce: all tests passed the first time I executed (normally, I never miss any occasion to do stupid mistakes)
