== Haskell | Day 2: Cube Conundrum

I struggled a bit parsing the input.

What eventually helped was to realize, that every pair of a count and a color can be considered independently. There is no need to group them to draws with cubes of different colors. In other words: the colors can be considered independently.

=== Star 1

I have two helper functions to separate the ID from the draws and to choose one argument out of three given a color string:

[source,haskell,numbered]
----
include::solution.hs[tags=helpers]
----

With this, the solution to star1 looks as follows (see explanation in the comments):
[source,haskell,numbered]
----
include::solution.hs[tags=star1]
----

=== Star 2

Star 2 is quite similar besides there is just mapping, no filtering:
[source,haskell,numbered]
----
include::solution.hs[tags=star2]
----
