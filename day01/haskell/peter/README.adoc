== Haskell | Day 1: Trebuchet?!

The solution is run with `runhaskell solution.hs` (or alternatively compiled with `ghc solution.hs` which creates an binary `solution`).

=== Star 1

The solution consists in summing the scores for every line.

The scores for a line are calculated in the `score1` function

include::solution.hs[tags=star1]

=== Star 2

The solution for the second star uses a `score2` function which looks for digits spelled out in addition to simple digits. Not very elegant, but it works and is what I am able to do with my current Haskell skills.
