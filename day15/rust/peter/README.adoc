== Rust | Day 15: Lens Library

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/15[AoC|2023|15].

=== Star 2

A bit of reading comprehension, mostly.

The input is parsed into pairs of a label and an optional value on the fly.

Each box is actually kind of a hash map. Because insertion order needs to be preserved, I cannot just simply use rust's hash map. I guess `Vec` is faster anyhow.
