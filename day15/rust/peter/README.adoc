=== Star 2

A bit of reading comprehension, mostly.

The input is parsed into pairs of a label and an optional value on the fly.

The vec of boxes is essentially a hash map, each box inside is a bucket of values that produce the same hash. The algorithm to apply for collision resolution is probably something like link::https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Separate_chaining[separate chaining], but link::https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/[linked lists] are no fun.
