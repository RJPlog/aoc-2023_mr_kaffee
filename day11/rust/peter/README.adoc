== Day 11: Cosmic Expansion

https://rust-lang.org[Rust] solution to https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11[AoC|2023|11].

=== Input

Again a day for my `Grid` utility.

=== Star 1

This was kind of straight forward.

include::src/lib.rs[tags=star_1]

=== Star 2

Luckily, I did not really create a bigger version of the grid for part 1 but just adjusted coordinates. So the same solution worked out of the box for the second part. I messed up a little bit: I forgot to subtract one from the expansion factor (because the empty rows/columns are already counted once)
